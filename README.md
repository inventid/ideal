# Ideal
| Branch | Build status | Code coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Master | | |
| Develop | | | 

## What is it?

Ideal is a simple Ruby 2.1 compliant gateway to contact any banks using the Dutch iDeal protocol.
Since there was no decent one available, we decided to develop our own.
And now you can use it too!

## How to use it?

_I need to elaborate on this once I acutally built something_

### How to suggest improvements?

We are still actively developing Ideal for our internal use, but we would already love to hear your feedback. In case you have some great ideas, you may just [open an issue](https://github.com/inventid/ideal/issues/new). Be sure to check beforehand whether the same issue does not already exist.

### How can I contribute?

We feel contributions from the community are extremely worthwhile. If you use Ideal in production and make some modification, please share it back to the community. You can simply [fork the repository](https://github.com/inventid/ideal/fork), commit your changes to your code and create a pull request back to this repository.

If there are any issues related to your changes, be sure to reference to those. Additionally we use the `develop` branch, so create a pull request to that branch and not to `master`.

### Collaborators

We would like to thank the developers which contributed to Ideal, both big and small.
